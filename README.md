* TIME ->  Python has defined a module, “time” which allows us to handle various operations regarding time, its conversions, and representations, which find their use in various applications in life.
 In this code, we are using time.sleep function.
-sleep(sec):- This method is used to halt the program execution for the time specified in the arguments.

* OS -> The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Python's standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. The *os* and *os. path* modules include many functions to interact with the file system.In this code we are using os.remove() / os.listdir() / os.getcwd() ...and many more functions.
